- [ZFP](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/zfp) is a compression library developed by LLNL.  We developed a forked [version](https://github.com/SEP-software/zfp-par) of the library to enable parallelism in the compression and decompression using all modes. The library supports C, Fortran, and C++, and python. An example of using it can be found [here](https://github.com/SEP-software/zfp-repo-example).
